# Design Patterns
- A design pattern is a well-described solution to a common software problem.
- They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.
- The pattern is not a specific piece of code, but a general concept for solving a particular problem. 
- Some of the benefits of using design patterns are:
	- Design patterns are already defined and provide an industry-standard approach to solving a recurring problem, so it saves time if we sensibly use the design pattern.
	- Using design patterns promotes re-usability that leads to more robust and highly maintainable code. It helps in reducing the total cost of ownership (TCO) of the software product.
	- Since design patterns are already defined, it makes our code easy to understand and debug. It leads to faster development and new members of the team understand it easily.

- Java design patterns are divided into three categories: `creational`, `structural`, and `behavioral` design patterns.


## Creational Design Patterns

- Creational design patterns provide solutions to instantiate an Object in the best possible way for specific situations.

    |    | Patterns                               |
    | :- | :------------------------------------- |
    | 1  | `Singleton Pattern`                    |
    | 2  | [Factory Pattern](/FactoryDesign.md)   |
    | 3  | `Abstract Factory Pattern`             |
    | 4  | `Builder Pattern`                      |
    | 5  | `Prototype Pattern`                    |


## Structural Design Patterns

- Structural design patterns provide different ways to create a Class structure (for example, using inheritance and composition to create a large Object from small Objects).

- Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

    |    | Patterns             |
    | :- | :------------------- |
    | 1  | `Adapter Pattern`    |
    | 2  | `Composite Pattern`  |
    | 3  | `Proxy Pattern`      |
    | 4  | `Flyweight Pattern`  |
    | 5  | `Facade Pattern`     |
    | 6  | `Bridge Pattern`     |
    | 7  | `Decorator Pattern`  |

## Behavioral Design Patterns

- Behavioral patterns provide a solution for better interaction between objects and how to provide loose-coupling and flexibility to extend easily.

- Behavioral patterns take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

    |    | Patterns                           |
    | :- | :--------------------------------- |
    | 1  | `Template Method Pattern`          |
    | 2  | `Mediator Pattern`                 |
    | 3  | `Chain of Responsibility Pattern`  |
    | 4  | `Observer Pattern`                 |
    | 5  | `Strategy Pattern`                 |
    | 6  | `Command  Pattern`                 |
    | 7  | `State Pattern`                    |
    | 8  | `Visitor Pattern`                  |
    | 9  | `Interpreter Pattern`              |
    | 10 | `Iterator Pattern`                 |
    | 11 | `Memento Pattern`                  |


## Miscellaneous Design Patterns

|    | Patterns                           |
| :- | :--------------------------------- |
| 1  | `DAO Design Pattern`               |
| 2  | `Dependency Injection Pattern`     |
| 3  | `MVC Pattern`                      |
